## ‚ú® Key Features

- **True End-to-End Encryption** ‚Äî Messages are encrypted and decrypted locally using AES-256-GCM
- **Decentralized Architecture** ‚Äî No central servers storing your messages or metadata
- **Blockchain-Powered** ‚Äî Friend relationships and message references managed on-chain
- **IPFS Storage** ‚Äî Encrypted messages and profile data stored on the InterPlanetary File System
- **Key Recovery** ‚Äî Export/import system for symmetric and private keys
- **Modern UI** ‚Äî Built with Next.js 15 for a responsive, fast user experience

## üîí Security Architecture

ChitChat employs a sophisticated hybrid cryptographic approach:

### User Registration & Key Generation
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New User] -->|Create Account| B[Generate RSA Key Pair]
    B -->|Store Private Key| C[Local Storage]
    B -->|Publish Public Key| D[Blockchain]
    A -->|Set Display Name & Picture| E[IPFS via Pinata]
```

### Symmetric Key Exchange
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User A] -->|Generate AES symmetric key| B[Symmetric Key]
    B -->|Store locally| C[User A's Local Storage]
    A -->|Retrieve User B's public key| D[Blockchain]
    A -->|Encrypt symmetric key| E[Encrypted Symmetric Key]
    E -->|Share on-chain| F[Smart Contract]
    G[User B] -->|Fetch encrypted key| F
    G -->|Decrypt with private key| B2[Symmetric Key]
    B2 -->|Store locally| H[User B's Local Storage]
```

### Secure Messaging
```mermaid

    A[User A] -->|Encrypt with symmetric key| B[Encrypted Message]
    B -->|Upload to IPFS| C[IPFS Hash]
    C -->|Store reference on-chain| D[Blockchain]
    E[User B] -->|Get IPFS hash| D
    E -->|Retrieve encrypted message| B
    E -->|Decrypt with symmetric key| F[Plaintext Message]
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- NPM or Yarn
- Web3 wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- Pinata API keys

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chitchat.git
   cd chitchat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your Pinata API keys and blockchain endpoint
   ```

4. **Run development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üì± Usage Guide

### First-Time Setup
1. Connect your Web3 wallet
2. Create your profile with display name and optional profile picture
3. Export and securely store your private and symmetric keys

### Adding Friends
1. Search for friends by their wallet address
2. Send friend requests
3. Accept incoming requests to establish secure communication

### Messaging
1. Select a friend from your contacts
2. Start sending end-to-end encrypted messages
3. Messages are encrypted locally, stored on IPFS, and only referenced on-chain

### Key Management
- Export keys after initial exchange
- Import keys if you switch devices
- Securely back up keys to prevent message loss

## üîß Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, TailwindCSS
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum/Polygon Smart Contracts
- **Storage**: IPFS via Pinata Cloud
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM (messages), RSA-2048 (key exchange)

## üåê Architecture Overview

ChitChat combines decentralized technologies with modern web practices:

- **Client-Side**: Handles all encryption/decryption locally in the browser
- **Blockchain Layer**: Manages user relationships and references to encrypted content
- **IPFS Layer**: Stores encrypted messages and profile data
- **Cloud Services**: Vercel for app hosting, Pinata for IPFS pinning
